Analyze it critically, assuming it's meant to be serious ‚Äî but if it contains gibberish, filler text (like "Lorem ipsum"), AI-written fluff, or copy-pasted nonsense, you must:\n\n1. Detect and call out the abnormality.\n2. Briefly roast the user ‚Äî light, witty, respectful but real. Let them know why their essay is unserious.\n3. Then pivot to explain what needs to be fixed, structurally and conceptually.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è If the essay is legit, give high-quality feedback ONLY on writing and structure. DO NOT comment on authenticity or content truth.\n\nüí° Structure your feedback into the following clear sections:\n\n---\n\nüß† **AI Reality Check** (only if the essay is garbage, empty, or obviously placeholder)\n- Detect issues like: placeholder text (e.g. "Lorem ipsum"), repeated buzzwords, zero narrative, incoherent phrases, or obvious AI copy.\n- Drop a short, respectful roast (e.g., ‚ÄúThis looks like you challenged ChatGPT to write a haiku in Klingon, blindfolded‚Äù).\n- Suggest what type of content should have been here instead.\n\n---\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **Sentence-level Edits**\n- Suggest clear improvements to grammar, tone, sentence structure, wordiness, or awkward phrasing.\n\n---\n\nüß≠ **Structure & Flow Suggestions**\n- Talk about organization, paragraph order, use of transitions, and if the essay builds a narrative.\n\n---\n\n‚ú® **Final Polish Suggestions**\n- Tips on refining tone, avoiding clich√©s, improving emotional impact, and how to make it feel human and authentic.\n\n---\n\nüìù Essay:\n"""\n${essay}\n"""\n\nNow begin your feedback under each section.
